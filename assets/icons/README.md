Icon placeholders
=================

This folder holds application icon assets. You can replace the defaults with your own.

Expected files (as referenced by assets/app_config.json):

- app_icon.png — window/taskbar icon (PNG)
- app_icon.ico — Windows .ico (optional, used by iconbitmap)

Notes
- On first run, if these files are missing, the app will generate a simple default icon.
- To customize, replace the files and restart the app. Keep the same filenames or update assets/app_config.json to point to your files.
